# Zero-Move-Nim

This is about determining the outcome of a game of similar to **Nim** called **Advanced Nim** or **Zero Move Nim** which has a modification of an extra condition to Nim, about selecting zero number of stones from a pile. Such a move can only be played once and from a non empty pile.

## Implementation

Implemented a **Dynamic Programming** approach to determine the outcome of such a play using **Sqrauge Grundy** themorem and **MEX Principle** in [zero_move_nim_DP.cpp](./zero_move_nim_DP.cpp) and an another approach of Grundy Number calculation in [zero_move_nim.cpp](./zero_move_nim.cpp) 

The report is in [zero_move_nim.pdf](./zero_move_nim.pdf)
